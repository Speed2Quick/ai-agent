# ai-agent
Very light version of an agentic ai (using gemini 2.5 flash) for coding assistance.

The user can enter a prompt in the CL which the agent will try to execute.

The agent can:
1. list directories
2. read files
3. write to files
4. run Python files

This was created for learning purposes and does not currently have security features for heavy usage.
